Trainer: [[Hi|Hello|Howdy]], welcome (yourself) to your training of Gava.
Trainer: (though atleast currently broken, so needed some welp...)
Trainer: So What was i saying uhhh[wait=0.2] yeah, Gava, is a mesmerizing little grogramming language based on the real world language of... [wait=1] 
#Probably should give an introduction of a bug with the grogramming example, but too much text
Trainer: Okay, will stop pretending like you don't know, well as you (probably might have) guessed..
Trainer: This is a training game and there is a l000t of text. So be prepared to "read" very much. So 
Trainer: You will have to free the "snippets" from few pesky little bugs to make it show it's [wave] real purpose...[/wave]
Trainer: Instead of it just annoying us with error codes (and me annoying you with walls of text ~.~)
Trainer: Lets start with the basics, shall we?

Trainer: Woah, look at that, you completed the level!
Trainer: [wave]Lets move too the next one...
=> END
#TODO: With or without looking at the hint choices

~ W1Level2Start
Trainer: So this is a little harder than the previous one, but nothing you can't solve[wait=0.2] (maybe)
Trainer: Incase you might need some help, I'll just try to simplify the root of the problem using an [wave][i]analogy[/i][/wave]
Trainer: Lets just say... We store information in boxes. A box for whole numbers is called int. A box for words is called String.
Trainer: You are not supposed put words in a number box!
=> END

~ W1Level2End

Trainer: Well, hope that was easier than I said it was... maybe... So
Trainer: [wave]Lets move to the next one.
=> END

~ W1Level3Start
Trainer: Now from the next one onwards, I'll just leave it up to you and stop my bothering with the constant yapping...
=> END

~ W1Level3End

Trainer: Nice,
Trainer: You can say that you won the game here (if you're a noob in Java), and all others are just extra levels (which can be hard sometimes and do not have hints for now)
Trainer: For those who want to continue, you are on your own from now on- 
Trainer: and remember, modern solutions require modern solutions?
Trainer: Uhhh whatever, just duckduckgo it if stuck (you know what you to do if a hint is not enough)..
Trainer: So goodluck and-
Trainer: [wave][[Lets move to the next one|Here comes another one|Next one oncoming..]]
=> END

~ W2Level1Start
Trainer: Also, the changes might not be related to the elaborate syntax (like the missing keywords [b]public, static[/b]), but mostly structural related..
Trainer: I had said I won't return but the dev can't handle scope creep properly unfortunately...
=> END

~ W2Level1End

Trainer: Onto the next one..
